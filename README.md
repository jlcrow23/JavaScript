# JavaScript

# Overview

With this project, I was trying to make my JavaScript skills stronger. I learned how to do this ToDo list by watch a few youtube videos. 

This ToDo list was created using a lot of different elements of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

The purpose of this software is to be creative while also learning more JavaScript.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with Live Preview extension installed. The Live Preview extension was a great help because I could see my code update without having a server.

The programming language used for this was JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Future Work

- I would like to add more styling to this and make a few changes.
- I would also like to add a save completed function to look back on what was done already.
- I would also like to be able to work in JavaScript faster and more efficiently.
- For some reason my category for social is going Social so the css is not formatting. I'll have to dig deeper into this later.
